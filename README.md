## Introduction
DPE_module v1.0 is a Direct Position Estimation (DPE) plug-in module that can be integrated into existing two-step positioning (2SP) MATLAB SDRs. 2SP information, namely tracking code phase, signal transmission time, receiver local time, satellite position from Least Squares, satellite clock bias, and Least Squares position solution, are used as input for the plug-in module. 

Programmed in a user-friendly language, MATLAB, DPE_module v1.0 is aimed for better understanding and familiarity of a practical implementation of DPE. In this repository, DPE_module v1.0 is integrated into the SoftGNSS MATLAB GPS L1 C/A 2SP SDR from Borre et al. (2007), which is based on Scalar Tracking Loop (STL). But integration of DPE_module v1.0 is not restricted to an STL-based receiver and can be integrated with other 2SP architectures, such as Vector Tracking Loop (VTL). Additionally, the GNSS constellation is not restricted to GPS L1 C/A, but is also integrable with SDRs working with other BPSK-modulated GNSS signals. 

DPE_module v1.0 would use the grid-based method, by which of establishing a set of candidate position, velocity, and time (PVT) and obtaining the correlations from each satellite before finally non-coherently summing them up to obtain the candidate position with the highest signal correlation, which would be the PVT estimate of DPE. Position as well as receiver clock bias estimate from 2SP are also used as initialization for the grid of candidate position. An illustration is provided below (Vicenzo et al. 2024)

Instead of iteratively computing the signal correlations per every candidate position, our DPE plug-in module pre-calculates the correlations per every pre-determined chip spacing or code phase. This implementation was previously used by previous research on collective detection, which is another name for DPE, to save computational time (Axelrad et al., 2009; Cheong et al., 2011). 

Parts of SoftGNSS v3.0 have been adapted to allow the DPE_module v1.0 to be integrated into it. 

## Running the software
The software presented in this repository is a SoftGNSS v3.0 that has been integrated with DPE_Module v1.0, and using it follows the same steps as running a regular SoftGNSS v3.0. Modifications were made to SOftGNSS v3.0 to also run on 16-bit samples (`int16` or `short` data types). 

When running with 16-bit data samples, use `int16` in `settings.dataType` (instead of `short`). On the other hand, use `schar` in `settings.dataType` (instead of `int8`) when running with 8-bit data samples.

Further information on using the software can be found in the original SoftGNSS v3.0 readme `readme - SoftGNSS.txt` and ppt `GPS_L1_CA_SDR.pdf`.

## DPE_module configuration
All DPE_module v1.0 parameters can be edited from `initSettings.m`, which are listed below.

1. `settings.candPVT_spacing` = Grid spacing for the latitude-longitude-height estimation (Default = 1 meter)

2. `settings.DPE_latlong_span` = Span of latitude and longitude search space (Default = ±30 meters)

3. `settings.DPE_height_span` = Span of height search space (Default = ±50 meters)

4. `settings.DPE_clkBias_span` = Span of clock bias search space (Default = ±20 meters)

5. `settings.DPE_nonCohInt` = DPE non-coherent integration time (Default = 1 ms) to improve the performance of DPE as the satellite correlations would be more filtered

6. `settings.DPE_plotCorrelogram` = Output the correlograms, plotted at the estimated DPE height

7. `settings.gt_llh` = Ground truth coordinates in geodetic coordinates to output the positioning errors from both DPE and 2SP

8. `settings.chipspacing_dpe_precalc` = Chip spacings between the pre-calculated correlations (Default = chips/sample)

## Dependencies
DPE_module v1.0 was developed with MATLAB2022a and it is recommended to run the program with the same version or later. Running the program with other MATLAB versions has yet to be tested. No additional MATLAB toolbox is required i.e., it can run with just the basic MATLAB package and no additional toolboxes.

Dependencies of the underlying SoftGNSS v3.0 can be found in its readme file `readme - SoftGNSS.txt`

## Sample IF datasets
Sample GPS L1 C/A intermediate frequency (IF) datasets can be accessed through the following link

`DATA TYPE`			: 'schar' or 'int8' 			(settings.dataType = 'schar')

`FILE TYPE`			: IQ 					(settings.fileType = 2)

`FRONT-END BANDWIDTH`		: 56 MHz

## Author

DPE_module v1.0 was written by Sergio Vicenzo, inspired by the multicorrelator-based DPE (Corr-DPE) written by HaoSheng Xu and Dr. Bing Xu, which was previously introduced in (Vicenzo et al. 2023).

Sergio Vicenzo is currently a PhD candidate at the Department of Aeronautical and Aviation Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. He received first-class honours in Bachelor of Engineering in Aviation Engineering from the same university in 2022. He is supervised by Assistant Professor Bing Xu, and co-supervised by Associate Professor Li-Ta Hsu. His research interests include GNSS urban navigation and positioning with direct position estimation.
